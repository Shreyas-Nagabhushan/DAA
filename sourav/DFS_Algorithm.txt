Algorithm: DFS(graph, start):
//Input: A graph with an adjacency matrix
//Output: A sequence of vertices in dfs order

    stack = []
    visited = false for all n vertices

    visited[start] = true
    push start onto stack

    while stack is not empty:
        current = pop stack
        print current

        for each unvisited neighbour of current:
            visited[neighbour] = true
            push neighbour onto stack
